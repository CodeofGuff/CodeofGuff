# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,

My name is David, but people usually call me Guff!</br>
I am a self-taught programmer with a eagerness for learning all things tech related. 

## Focus

 My current focus is on the React library for Web Development. 
 I am hoping for the chance to dive into React Native for multi-platform applications as well.

## Learning and Collaboration

As my learning continues, I am looking for the chance to collaborate with others and learn from them. 
</br>As someone who has been an athlete, a competitive gamer, and working in challenging environments, I appreciate how to learn from the experience of others.
