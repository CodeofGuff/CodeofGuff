# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,

My name is David, but people usually call me Guff from my last name, Guffre.
I am a self-taught programmer with a huge passion for learning all things tech related. 
If you are here I assume you are coming from Linkedin or another Social so feel free to browse around and check out some of my work. 
I try and keep all my Read Me's up to date as I can. 

## About Me

My current main learning focus is in the Swift language. I am using many different tools and avenues to get a well-rounded understanding as I pivot careers.

- I started with HTML/CSS to grab some basics of web design.
- I quickly found Godot and GD.Script after and delved into some game design. 
- To understand what programming is more deeply though, I learned with Python.
- I practiced Python a bit with my brother to understand problem solving with it.
   </br>He has been programming for 20+ years, mainly in C and Python recently. [Check out his Repo here!](https://github.com/guffre)

After reviewing his programs and techniques, I knew this was something I wanted to pursue further and explore deeply. 
</br> I have enjoyed diving deep into the Swift language because I feel it offers so much, and I am eager to see what that is.

## Current Focus

I am focusing on iOS development / design, along side other languages to have an understanding of them when I need to use them. 
</br> My goal is to ensure I can not only deploy a full app but also make it scalable and refined.

## Learning and Collaboration

As my learning continues, I want to collaborate with others and learn from them. 
</br>As someone who has been an athlete, a competitive gamer, and working in challenging environments, I appreciate how to learn from the experience of others.
