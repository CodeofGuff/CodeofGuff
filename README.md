# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,

My name is David, but people usually call me Guff from my last name, Guffre.

## About Me

My current main learning focus is in the Swift language. I am using many different tools and avenues to get a well-rounded understanding as I pivot careers.

- I started slow with HTML/CSS to grab some basics of web design.
- I quickly found Godot and GD.Script after and delved into some game design. 
- To understand what programming is more deeply though, I learned Python.
- I practiced Python a bit with my brother to understand problem solving with it.
   </br>He has been programming for 20+ years, mainly in C and Python recently. [Check out his Repo here!](https://github.com/guffre)

After reviewing his programs and techniques, I knew this was something I wanted to pursue further and explore deeply. 
</br> I have made the pivot to diving deep into the Swift language because I feel it offers so much, and I am eager to see what that is.

## Current Focus

I am focusing on iOS development but also diving deep into backend architecture, design, and other languages such as JS and Python. 
</br> My goal is to ensure I can not only deploy a full app but also make it scalable, neat, and refined.

## Learning and Collaboration

As my learning continues, I want to collaborate with others and learn from them. 
</br>As someone who has been an athlete, a competitive gamer, and worked in challenging environments, I like to think of myself as someone who knows how to learn from experience and from others.

I can't wait to be part of this awesome tech community!
