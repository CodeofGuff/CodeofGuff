# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,

My name is David, but people usually call me Guff!</br>
I am a self-taught programmer with a eagerness for learning all things tech related. 

## Focus

 My current focus is in the wonderful Apple garden. 
 I enjoy the Swift language so much I decided to make it my focus. The reward of seeing my programming come to life
 on a watch, phone, laptop, tablet, tv, or headset is amazing. 

 Getting in the development side of computers later in life, I enjoy the unified nature of the Apple ecosystem and development enviroment.
